	Ensuring secure access to systems and sensitive data is a growing challenge in today's interconnected world. Behavioral authentication introduces a promising approach to traditional authentication methods. However, single-factor behavioral authentication systems suffer from various limitations. This paper proposes the potential of a multi-factor behavioral authentication (MFBA) framework, which integrates multiple behavioral traits into a unified system to address these limitations. As a concept, the MFBA may advance the field of digital security, offering an enhanced accuracy, reliability, and resilience to single-factor behavioral authentication systems.
