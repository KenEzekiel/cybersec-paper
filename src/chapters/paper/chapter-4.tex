\section{Proposed Solution}

To address the limitataions and challenges identified in \ref{sec:problem-analysis}. One possibility of solution is to integrate multiple behavioral authentication modalities into a unified multifactor behavior authentication framework.

The key idea is to leverage the complementary nature of different behavioral traits to mitigate the limitations of individual modalities. By aggregating and analyzing data from multiple sources. A more robust authentication model that is more resilient to variability and adversarial attacks may be built.
% Would be nice to throw in some examples from chapter-2
