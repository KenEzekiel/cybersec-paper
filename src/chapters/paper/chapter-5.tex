\section{Conclusion}
Through this paper we have explored the potential of multifactor behavioral authentication (MFBA) as a robust alternative to traditional and single-factor behavioral authentication systems. By integrating complementary behavioral traits, the MFBA system minimizes the limitations of individual modalities, paving the way for a more robust authentication framework.

Future work will focus on actual implementation and analysis of the concept. Extensive field testing across behavioral authentication system implementations should also be conducted to prove the solution as proposed in this paper.

In conclusion, the MFBA framework is a promising concept in the field of behavioral authentication, combining multiple factors to create a more secure, accurate, and user-friendly authentication solution. The MFBA framework has the potential to significantly enhance the way digital security is handled in an increasingly interconnected world.
