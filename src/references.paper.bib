  abstractnote = {User authentication is considered to be an important aspect of any cyber security program. However, one-time validation of user’s identity is not strong to provide resilient security throughout the user session. In this aspect, continuous monitoring of session is necessary to ensure that only legitimate user is accessing the system resources for entire session. In this paper, a true continuous user authentication system featuring keystroke dynamics behavioural biometric modality has been proposed and implemented. A novel method of authenticating the user on each action has been presented which decides the legitimacy of current user based on the conﬁdence in the genuineness of each action. The 2-phase methodology, consisting of ensemble learning and robust recurrent conﬁdence model(R-RCM), has been designed which employs a novel perception of two thresholds i.e., alert and ﬁnal threshold. Proposed methodology classiﬁes each action based on the probability score of ensemble classiﬁer which is afterwards used along with hyperparameters of R-RCM to compute the current conﬁdence in genuineness of user. System decides if user can continue using the system or not based on new conﬁdence value and ﬁnal threshold. However, it tends to lock out imposter user more quickly if it reaches the alert threshold. Moreover, system has been validated with two different experimental settings and results are reported in terms of mean average number of genuine actions (ANGA) and average number of imposter actions(ANIA), whereby achieving the lowest mean ANIA with experimental setting II.},

  abstractnote = {Due to the increasing vulnerabilities in cyberspace, security alone is not enough to prevent a breach, but cyber forensics or cyber intelligence is also required to prevent future attacks or to identify the potential attacker. The unobtrusive and covert nature of biometric data collection of keystroke dynamics has a high potential for use in cyber forensics or cyber intelligence. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of keystroke dynamics to establish the person identity. We propose three schemes for identifying a person when typing on a keyboard. We use various machine learning algorithms in combination with the proposed pairwise user coupling technique and show the performance of each separate technique as well as the performance when combining two or more together. In particular, we show that pairwise user coupling in a bottom–up tree structure scheme gives the best performance, both concerning accuracy and time complexity. The proposed techniques are validated by using keystroke data. However, these techniques could equally well be applied to other pattern identiﬁcation problems. We have also investigated the optimized feature set for person identiﬁcation by using keystroke dynamics. Finally, we also examined the performance of the identiﬁcation system when a user, unlike his normal behaviour, types with only one hand, and we show that performance then is not optimal, as was to be expected.},
